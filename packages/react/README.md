## Introduction

Laravel Precognition allows you to anticipate the outcome of a future request. Some ways Precognition may be used include:

- Live validation of forms, powered by Laravel validation rules.
- Notifying users that a resource they are editing has been updated since it was retrieved.
- Notifying users their session has expired.

This library provides the core functionality used by the [Vue](https://github.com/laravel/precognition-vue) and [React](https://github.com/laravel/precognition-react) framework libraries.
